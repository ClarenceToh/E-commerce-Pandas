# E-commerce-Pandas
Pandas Application on eCommerce data from various sources.

## Project 1
### dataset
This dataset originally came from an ecommerce company in which I applied for an internship for. 

The dataset is the base for the technical test which they put all potential interns through. 

Glad that I passed the test and received the offer, but did not do the internship due to conflicts in schedule.

Note: the dataset did not have data on the order date, or any geolocation data which could have provided more interesting insights for the business.

Further EDA done becuse I was interested in it.

## Project 2
### Olist.ipynb
The Olist dataset is an open source dataset that is available on Kaggle. Olist operates an online e-commerce site for sellers, that connects merchants and their products to main marketplaces. The company is from Brazil. 

The code mainly demonstrates calling from kaggle api, performing merges on dataframes and analyses on consumer behaviour (effect of freight, estimated delivery times and review scores).
